Comment.create!(description:"I met Amma when she had first started her photography business. The first wedding she did was my sister's, and Amma was a natural. I watched her business grow over the next few years and once I got engaged, I knew that I had to use her. Amma did not disappoint! She makes every step of the process easy and stress free. She manages a crowd with ease, is able to capture every important moment, and has the most positive attitude. We absolutely love our pictures and have the best memories from that day. Highly recommend!",date:Date.new(2018,4,7),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p2.id)
Comment.create!(description:"Bryan is simply amazing but you already know that by his other raving reviews. So let me give you some details on why we loved working with him. 1. His shooting style. Bryan is a photographing ninja. Don't let the lack of a second shooter fool you. Judging by the photo's we've received, you'd never know there was only one photographer. Bryan somehow managed to be in two places at once at all times. Bryan also takes AMAZING candids. My husbands aunt grinding with our groomsmen- documented. My bridesmaids taking selfies- busted. Large groups taking shots at the bar- got it. You can feel all of the love and joy in every photo and I absolutely LOVE them. You have a photographer so you can relive the best day of your life and Bryan has provided us with photos to do just that. 2. He's fast. I mean this in regards to multiple things. He has always responded to my emails quickly, sometimes within minutes (very important when wedding planning) and delivered my wedding photos in TWO WEEKS. That is super fast for a wedding photographer. I can't even tell you how perfect it was to come home from our two week honeymoon to an email from Bryan letting us know our photos were ready. 3. He's super accommodating and creative and was down for our ideas when it came to our engagement photos. He also gave us great guidance when it came to wedding logistics and the day-of timeline. Having someone with so much experience was so helpful when planning the big day. 4. This one might not seem like a big deal but it really is. Bryan was just so easy to work with. With the chance that so many things can go wrong, having a photographer that is able to just do their thing without a lot of back and forth is really appreciated. I never had to worry about him. He understood us as a couple, was always prompt, easy going, and professional. He has a great personality and brings such positive vibes with him where ever he goes. I highly recommend Bryan and would choose him again and again. Do yourself a favor and just book him. You won't be disappointed.",date:Date.new(2018,7,2),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p1.id)
Comment.create!(description:"We had the pleasure of seeing Bryan's work for my brother's wedding in May 2016. We weren't even engaged yet, but the next day, we both said that if we were to get married, we were definitely hiring Bryan as our photographer! From the moment we emailed him, we knew that we had made the right choice. Even though he typically doesn't do weddings in Philadelphia, he had no issue doing our engagement photos and wedding out there. He put us at ease during the engagement photo shoot - which is definitely an awkward experience! But he made it fun and found some outstanding shots for us in places we hadn't even considered. He also put up with our 6 month old lab puppy wandering the city with us! On the day of our wedding, Bryan took some wonderful shots of the guys and girls getting ready. He took so many photos during the ceremony and the reception that I don't even know how one person was able to capture so many pictures by himself! He truly captured the love and fun that we had that day and we love going through our album and reliving it all.",date:Date.new(2018,11,10),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p1.id)
Comment.create!(description:"I can not recommend Bryan enough to anyone planning their weddings. Friends of ours used Bryan for their wedding several years back and after seeing their album, I knew he would be my first call when I got engaged. Not only is Bryan immensely talented, he’s also responsive, flexible, and seems to be everywhere you’d want him to be (a total photo ninja as others have mentioned). Additionally, he’s super fast when it comes to delivering the final pics - no waiting months and months and months! The pictures are beyond beautiful and we cannot thank him enough for capturing our day in such an authentic and natural way. Hire Bryan now!!",date:Date.new(2018,11,02),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p1.id)

Comment.create!(description:"Me and my mom met Arken at Times Square, and asked him to take our picture on our iPhone and we liked the way he captured our photo. He made us smile, asked to do different poses. Ended up that he is a professional photographer that focuses on couples and capturing the love. It was only 5 days before my wedding, and we didn't hire any professional photographer for the wedding day, since our family friend promised to take the pictures that day, but i really liked Arken's attitude and approach so i asked him if he is available in 5 days to shoot my wedding in Illinois! Luckily we were able to hire him and booked him a flight for our wedding. Price was very affordable for us and pictures came out amazing, we cherish them and look at the photos everyday on our wall. highly recommended!",date:Date.new(2018,10,10),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p3.id)

Comment.create!(description:"Casey was everything my fiance´ and I hoped to find in a photographer for our wedding. He was a true partner in making memories, and we can’t recommend him highly enough. The Planning: Casey is extremely detail-oriented and thoughtful in his approach. By completing his engagement session and wedding questionnaires, Casey really gets to know you as a couple and highlights what makes your love unique. As a bonus, you suddenly find you have a basis for vows and have thought through the entire timeline of your wedding! The Process: From our first consultation to the last shutter-click at our wedding reception, we felt listened to and at-ease with Casey. He is a very kind, warm soul who makes the process stress-free. For us, it was important that we didn’t feel directed and posed, but if a couple needs some extra help, he will give it in the way that’s right for them. When it came to the engagement shoot, Casey was up for anything! From making friends with our pups to joining us in a shot of engagement whiskey during the shoot, we felt like we were just hanging out with our super-talented friend who happened to be a photographer. On the wedding day, Casey and his second shooter, Angel, arrived and got to work with a full understanding of and respect for the day’s timeline. Our guests, other vendors, and venue coordinators kept raving that they had never seen a photographer work so quickly and efficiently. Group portraits didn’t take an unnecessary amount of time. Casey is a pro at getting what he needs and sending you/your guests back to the celebration. One of my favorite parts of working with Casey is throughout the day and night, special, small moments would happen and I would think, “Oh, I wish Casey were here so we had a picture of that.” Without fail, Casey or Angel would be there. They were always ready, and ever-present, but never in the way or stopping the joy of the day from unfolding naturally. The Photos: Simply put, Casey’s photos look like memorable moments of your life at their most beautiful. It was very important to us that our photos weren’t overly posed and had true-to-life color vs the very washed out you sometimes see in wedding photography, and Casey delivered in spades. The photos are gorgeous, emotional, and real. They look like a mixture beautiful movie stills and creative, artistic shots - which is exactly what we wanted. Casey gave us a few teaser photos to hold us over, but the real deal didn’t take long! He turned around both our engagement photos and wedding photos in roughly a week, and included a slideshow of wedding photos that we could share with friends and family. I can’t think of any other newlywed couple we know who got their wedding photos back so quickly without sacrificing quality. It is wonderful when you get to work with someone who is a stellar human, talented, and feels like they are on your team. Casey is all this.",date:Date.new(2018,10,23),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p5.id)
Comment.create!(description:"We were really meticulous in finding a photographer for our wedding day. When we came across Casey we loved his appreciation for photography and his eye for capturing emotion. Most importantly he loves what he does, in addition to being extremely talented. He made us feel really comfortable during our engagement shoot, when neither of us had taken professional photos before and felt nervous, and he got the photos back to us in LESS THAN A WEEK. We were amazed. On our wedding day as well he captured such special moments, emotions, and light. We were so happy with how the photos turned out and have revisited them again and again since. And we have to reiterate how quickly we received the retouched wedding photos back! We loved being able to go through them during our honeymoon. Casey also makes the nitty-gritty administrative stuff extremely easy through his online portal, and also by just generally knowing what he’s doing (he has years and years of experience doing this). At any point if we had a question for Casey he was never more than a call/email away and was always very prompt and professional about answering. We would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a talented, friendly, and thoughtful photographer for any occasion. Thank you Casey!",date:Date.new(2018,11,10),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p5.id)
Comment.create!(description:"Kala is AMAZING!!!! When she first started out, we hired her as a second photographer for our son's wedding and then our daughter's wedding 2 months later, and actually preferred and used Kala's photographs more than the 'seasoned' photographers that we had hired! So when our daughter Rilee got married 3 years later, we hired Kala as our #1 (and only) photographer and her pictures blew us away! Not only does she capture every important moment, but she does it in a way that you almost don't even know she is there! She is beyond easy to work with and adds a lightness to the air so everyone is at ease and comfortable in her presence. We have one more daughter, and you can be assured that when she gets engaged, Kala will be one of our first phone calls!!! :)",date:Date.new(2018,7,10),user_id: User.all.sample.id, photographer_id:p6.id)
